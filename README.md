Say Hello - Endpoint
1/8/2024
Designing API endpoint that recieves user's input and and ouputs a greeting eith user's input

Peer Reviewed By: Tested on both Postman and Swagger. Functionality of the API works as intended. Populates my input and adds a randomly generated greeting to my input. Very intuitive adding multiple greetings.
